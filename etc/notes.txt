Below are the decisions and questions from our meeting. Please let me know if I missed anything. I don’t have Devon’s email to include her.

 

Localization (translation)
Should we include?
If so, which languages?
Should we use AI translations or will you provide?
Enforceable commitments
We are using the program columns in the data to show. Do we need to account for speed, technology or anything else in the data?
Local commitments will be added to the existing layer which is treated as a filter.
Show program name in the hover over. 
Data persistence
Should we keep the browser persistence – when you return the selection you had will remain.
Add a clear selection button.
Submitted challenges clear the selection.
Launch
Don’t show Submit Challenge button on launch. IL will provide a date/time when it should be active.
Remove or disable the button or show a message when someone clicks that you cannot submit a challenge until above date.
Intro text?
Twitter/social media card elements? 
CAI
Pass name and address for CAIs without a location ID.
Data exchange
CN will send example json
U of Chicago to have a dev endpoint ready by next week.
