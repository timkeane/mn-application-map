I also had to work from home during this time since the kids were home.  This resulted in me getting up early, sometimes at 4am so I could put in a good chunk of time before my kids were up and needed the bandwidth.  We all couldn't draw from the hot spot without frustrations and slowdown or being disconnected entirely.  I would also then put in time later at night to complete my full day.  Although school is no longer remote, we still have homework at night.  I also have to work from home occasionally, but there is a push to have regular remote days in the future.  We resorted to purchasing StarLink about a year ago, which was a large outlay of cash initially for the equipment.  There is a continual monthly cost of $110 ($1,320/year).  The price has gone up once in the year we've had it and I assume it will continue to rise.  I will not complain about the speed or connectivity.  Other than a few outages, the service has been wonderful.  I am fairly certain cables have been buried under our driveway in the last five years.    I recall at least two different operations working on burying things in this timeframe.

Each week we experience poor service and multiple outages.  I have written to contacts within Wabasha County and the State, including the Governor. Unfortunately, my questions and hopes for a positive outlook have fallen on deaf ears until Diane Wells from the Office of Broadband Development replied, suggesting I submit this application.  \n\nI worked for IBM for over 31 years, an international technology company and yet still today, in 2023, my family and I have access to some of the poorest internet options in the entire State of Minnesota. My husband who also works for IBM and still works from home is negatively impacted weekly, losing connections throughout the day often during critical meetings.  The coverage maps available clearly indicates better broadband coverage in Cook County in Northern Minnesota than there is in Wabasha County - WHY?! \n\nIf there is a local representative with responsibility for our area, I would appreciate you forwarding my message and sharing their contact information with me.

I have been trying to get broadband fiber internet since 2021 at my home.  I live on the corner of Highway 5 and Highway 1 of Cook, MN.  My neighbor on Highway 5 said that this winter they would be putting in Paul Bunyan to her location.  She is about 1/4 of a mile from my home.  When I type in my address because it is 12896 Highway 1 for Paul Bunyan they seem to think I am further away than what I actually am because my neighbor is right down the road and my home sits about 30 feet from Highway 5 on the corner.  I have begged and pleaded to get fiber at my home since 2021.  Most of the neighbors down highway 5 from my home want the internet.  Unless you see visibly how close I am to Highway 5 and how not far I am from my neighbors and the need for working my job at home with proper internet.  I hope that the broadband would go up Highway 5 to the corner of Highway 5 and Highway 1 in Cook, Mn so we are able to have proper internet to do my job.  I hope this is heard. I reached out to Paul Bunyan and they said I needed to come on here and plead my case.  I hope and pray that this will happen this fall so I am able to work and go to online school from home.

Annie is a teacher and often needs to upload and /or download files for her lesson plans and often is unable to complete these tasks because the internet times out. Our daughter who is in college, comes home and lives with us through the summer months and various times throughout the year and needs internet to complete assignments for class or for her internship. She struggles with getting connected and staying connected as she needs and uses high tech software programs that need higher speeds. As a family we like to stream movies and shows as we do not have cable tv. We struggle to have more than one device streaming or even browsing the internet. We also do all of our banking online and it gets extremely frustrating when the internet is out or is terribly slow. We really appreciate your consideration with this program. We look forward to hearing from someone soon.
